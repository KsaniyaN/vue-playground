Project that automates the seven git init steps

1. Create a Git repository in current folder
2. Create a remote repository in GitHub. 
3. Add Git repo as remote. 
4. Provide a simple interactive wizard for creating a .gitignore file. 
5. Add the contents of the folder and push it to the remote repo.
