<!-- # Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories. 

For example: -->

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

# Button
Button is the primary component. It has a few possible states.

- [Default](#default)
- [Disabled](#disabled)

### Default
<Story id="button" />

### Disabled
<Story id="button--disabled" />
